# Code Quiz

## Description

Here is a simple quiz about JavaScript fundamentals.

There are ten multiple choice questions, each with one correct answer. Upon selecting an answer, the user will be alerted to whether their answer was correct or incorrect and the next question will commence.

Score is kept by how many questions are answered correctly. 1 point is awarded for a correct answer, however, if their answer is incorrect, 15 seconds will be removed from their remaining time. The user has 75 seconds to complete the quiz.

Upon finishing the quiz, the user will be prompted to enter their name to save their score. This is optional and the user can opt to simply play the quiz again or exit the browser.

At the beginning and end of the quiz, the player can select "View High Scores" and see any scores that are currently stored in localStorage.
